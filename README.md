Hi and welcome to my github!

Just a little table of contents here.

* **Bubble** contains selected excerpts from the software I developed for my start-up.  These excerpts are a demonstration of the progression of a portion of the software's back end structure.  I wish that I could show more -- but much of the software is subject to Intellectual Property (IP) restrictions!

* **Convex** contains a 3D visual math system.  Functionalites include : 
	* A symbolic calculator / differentiator that I built from the ground up.  Users can input any multivariable polynomial function, take the Gradient or Hessian, and can perform Gradient Descent or Newtonâ€™s Method dynamic on all parameters -- all of which are all seen plotted visually in 3D.  Utilizes asynchronous programming for multitasking.
	* A linear program optimizer.  Users can input a Linear Program and perform the Simplex Method on it, visually, in 3D.
	
* Please check out my '**Component Loading**' Folder, it's something I am really excited about! (soon to be added : W and more)

* **StringBucket** is a very fast String Data Structure whose data points (nodes) are nodes in two separate linked lists and are hashed into an array (Use the StringBucket.java only use QuadLinkedStringBucket if you test it first (I will test it soon))

* **DataStructures** contains a variety of Data Structures that I've replicated. Check out my Binomial Queue, Cuckoo Hashed Hashmap (For actually guaranteed O(1) time) and my Splay Tree.

* **Chess** contains two programs: 
	* My first program ever! a very slow game of chess with graphics and many cool functionalities like automatic game save, PGN export, and it even tells you all your valid moves!
	* Chess written with graphics in 50 lines of java! (did it as a self-challenge)

* **Work in Progress** contains a Data Structure I was working on for a while that I will continue with at some point

Look out for my two upcoming publications: _Synthetic Math_ and _Bond Theory_! (Dynamic Functions tba)


**Thanks** and enjoy!
