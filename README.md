<p style="text-align:center"> Hi and welcome to my github! </p>

Just a little table of contents here!

Please check out my 'Component Loading' Folder, it's something I am really excited about

* **StringBucket** is a really fast String Data Structure whose data points (nodes) are nodes in two separate linked lists and are hashed into an array

* **DataStructures** contains all sorts of Data Structures that I've replicated. Check out my Binomial Queue, Cuckoo Hashed Hashmap (For actually guaranteed O(1) time) and my Splay Tree.

* **Chess** contains two things: 
	* My first program ever! a very slow game of chess with graphics and many cool functionalities like automatic game save, PGN export, and it even tells you all your valid moves!
	* Chess written with graphics in 50 lines of java! (did it as a self-challenge)

* **Work in Progress** contains a Data Structure I was working on for a while that I will continue on at some point

Look out for my two upcoming publications: _Synthetic Math_ and _Bond Theory_!


**Thanks** and enjoy!
